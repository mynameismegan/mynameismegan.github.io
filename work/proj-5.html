<p>Fight Club is a 1999 cult-classic film starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and based on the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The story surrounds a depressed man (Norton) who is miserable at his white-collar job and suffers from insomnia. He meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Pitt) who represents everything the man would like to be in his life. The two strike up a friendship, and form an underground fight club where other men who are discontented with their mundane lives fight each other. Fight Club’s core message outlines that corporate America has turned the population into mindless consumers, where the sum of a person’s worth is how much money they have in their bank account and the type of car they drive. My challenge was to capture the essence of this message and the dark suspense of the movie to the audience.</p>
