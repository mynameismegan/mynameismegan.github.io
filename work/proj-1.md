Mrs. Fields is a company that has specialized in selling premium quality cookies for over 40 years. They have grown from one store front in Palo Alto, California operated by Debbi Fields herself, to over 250 locations across the United States. The Mrs. Fields branding has been largely unchanged since it’s inception in 1977, and was in need of a revamp for it’s 40th anniversary. This included a new logo design, as well as advertisements which incorporate the art of famous street artist Banksy.
