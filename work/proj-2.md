Pot Sitter is an app I designed specially for people that are experiencing paranoid and/or
anxious feelings after consuming cannabis. A common issue among cannabis users is
erroneaously injesting an excessive amount either by inexperience or due to an inconsistent product 
and becoming "too high". While it is not possible to overdose on marijuana, people who do intake too much can enter
into a very panicked and paranoid state, and some will end up calling 911 or even admitting themselves to the hospital. <br>

With the recent legalization of marijuana, this has proven to be a problem for hospitals and poison control hotlines who are receiving an increasing number of calls for this reason. There is no treatment for someone who has consumed an excessive amount of cannabis except to wait until the effects wear off over time, so these incidents end up taking hospital resources away from people who really require
medical care. The intention of Pot Sitter is to take users through a variety of screens designed
to help calm the user down from their panicked state until the effects of the cannabis wear off
naturally. These screens include: an emotional self-assessment, a heart rate check, meditation, and the ability to chat with other users in the community.
