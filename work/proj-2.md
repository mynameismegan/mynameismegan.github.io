Perceptron is a new-age pixel typeface. It was especially designed for users who want to emote a high-tech
and contemporary feel to its audience. It has a similar construction of the classic bitmap typeface, but with some added flourishes that make it stand out from the pack. The typical hard corners and points of the pixels have been rounded, to give a modern aesthetic and allow for greater versatility of use. Perceptron is begging to be the logotype for the next big software startup, makerspace, or computer game.
