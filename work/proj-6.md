Rosy Reveal is a cosmetic microneedling kit that involves using fine needles to create hundreds of tiny invisible puncture wounds in the top layer of skin. The micro-injuries you create stimulates the bodyâ€™s natural wound healing processes, resulting in cell turnover and increased collagen and elastin production, therefore reversing as well as preventing signs of aging. It is fast becoming a popular treatment among skincare fanatics due to the fact that it is extremely inexpensive and can be performed at home. I was approached by the creator of Rosy Reveal, Mico Angelo Co., as they were looking for a fresh redesign of their brand. This included the Mico Angelo logo, the Rosy Reveal logo, the package design, and an informational pamphlet for the inside of the box.
