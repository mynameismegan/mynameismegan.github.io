Polisi is an all-women’s snowboard company that specializes in selling high-quality snowboards and accessories that are specially designed for women. Today’s snowboarding industry is heavily dominated by men. This is apparent in the media, where major snowboard films largely features only male snowboarders, or the typical snowboarding magazine whose articles and adverts all feature males. On top of this, the gear for female snowboarders is very limited, with only a small fraction of their product line marketed specifically for women. I wanted to create a brand that provided women who love the sport greater choice over the products they can choose from, and be able to have a board that was specifically designed with them in mind.
