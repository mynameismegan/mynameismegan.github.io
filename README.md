This site was built by following tutorials from the youtube channel [Dev Tips](https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners) 

The tutorial helped me set up my first website and I learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript along the way.

I have modified the templates to include my work, and I have changed certain elements like the colors and a few styles. I plan to continually add to and change up the design of this site, learning more and more HTML, CSS, and Javascript as I do it.
