blurb: >
  **Welcome! My name is Melissa.** I am a highly creative and enthusiastic individual with over 3 years
  of marketing experience across a variety of disciplines. Most recently, I left my hometown in
   Canada and moved to San Francisco in order to pursue a career in Graphic Design. My
    business background and creative education has allowed me to garner a unique set
  of skills and experiences that I am now eager to apply in the design industry.
