Alt D (Alternative Design) is a design magazine that features eclectic and unconventinal ideas from all faucets of the design industry. If itâ€™s out-there, Alt D has got it. Mainstream magazines can be often have generic a feel to them, while more specialized magazines are often not approachable for the average person. I wanted to create something that stood out on the stand, however was still consumable by the general public. Alt D is all about encouraging the public to engage in design, and open their minds to the amazing impact it is having on the world today, and where it may take us in the future.</p>
