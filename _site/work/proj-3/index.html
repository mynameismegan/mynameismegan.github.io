CANNABliss Chocolate is a line of cannabis-infused edibles that is specifically designed for the new-to-cannabis customer. In the past, cannabis brand package designs have marketed towards a younger audience, with designs typically relying on psychedelic color palettes and mascot logos to appeal to customers. With the recent legalization of marijuana, I sought to create a brand that would appeal to a more mature customer base. More specifically, first-time cannabis users that are curious to enter the market and are looking for a high-quality and trustworthy product.</p>
