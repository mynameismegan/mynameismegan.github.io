Polisi is an all-women’s snowboard company that specializes in selling high-quality snowboards and accessories that are specially designed for women. Today’s snowboarding industry is heavily dominated by men. This is apparent in the media, where major snowboard films, magazines, and advertising all feature males. On top of this, the gear for female snowboarders is very limited, with only a small fraction of their product lines marketed directly towards women. I wanted to create a brand solely for women that provided a greater choice of products that they could choose from, and to have gear that was intentionally and thoughtfully designed with them in mind.</p>
