BottleRock Napa Valley is an annual wine and rock music festival held in Napa, California that attracts over 120,000 attendees each year. Traditionally, BottleRock promotional materials are highly illustrative with intricate graphics done in a hand-drawn style. I created a brochure for festival attendees that leaned on a modern and clean style, but still captured the vibe of a rock festival. Additionally, I created an app for the festival with this same objective.</p>
