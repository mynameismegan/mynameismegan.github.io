<p>Computer programming is becoming an essential skill to know in today’s technology driven environment. This means that it is important to start education in code early on so that kids are ready to meet employers needs when they enter the workforce. Schwifty Car is a self-driving RC car that is designed to teach kids how to code. Schwifty Car reacts to elements and people in it’s environment, all of which is controlled by code. It provides kids with an introduction into the world of code and robotics through a fun and hands-on experience.</p>
