<p>Pot Sitter is an app designed specifically for people that are experiencing paranoid or
anxious feelings after consuming cannabis. A common issue among cannabis users is
erroneously ingesting an excessive amount, either by inexperience or due to an inconsistent product, 
and becoming “too high”. While it is not possible to overdose on marijuana, people who intake too much may enter
into a panicked and paranoid state, and resultantly call 911 or even admit themselves to the hospital. <br /></p>

<p>With the recent legalization of marijuana, this has proven to be a problem for hospitals and poison control hotlines who are receiving an increasing number of cannabis-related incidents, these incidents end up taking hospital resources away from people who really require medical care. There is no treatment for someone who has consumed an excessive amount of cannabis except to wait until the effects wear off over time, so the intention of Pot Sitter is to take users through a variety of screens designed to help relax the user until the effects of the cannabis wear off naturally. These screens include an emotional self-assessment, heart rate check, meditation, and the ability to chat with other users in the community.</p>
