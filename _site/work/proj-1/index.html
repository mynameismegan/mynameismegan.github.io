Wilderness Patrol is an app developed in 2019 by students at 42 Silicon Valley to aid the volunteers in Califroniaâ€™s State Parks in maintaining the integrity of the parks.</p>

<p>A volunteer will come across an issue, and drop a pin onto a digital map (shown below) to report the issue. This is automatically logged in the Issues List, which allows fellow volunteers to coordinate to resolve it.</p>

The Wilderness Patrol app is designed to allow users to navigate through the app as easily as possible without feeling lost. 
This was accomplished by reusing the same screens as often as possible, and ensuring that the user never had to navigate more than a depth of three clicks away from the main screen, as shown below.</p>
